Needs pygame to work

just go to the UI.py and set it up. The level refers to how many moves it looks ahead.

What it can do

- [X] Do basic moves
- [X] Play as both white and black
- [ ] Castle (still in the works)
- [ ] Do en passant (Will be on the works eventually)

There is a basic UI, but nothing fancy.
